# FundWise Issues

**Last indexed:** 2026-05-04
**Deadline:** 2026-05-11 Colosseum Frontier submission
**Current focus:** FW-005 (Zerion CLI readiness support) is now shipped as a narrow script-only demo; resolve the FW-007 Source Currency / Expense Proof ship decision next.

This file is the local issue index for hackathon execution. Keep each issue as a vertical slice: a completed issue should be independently demoable, testable, or useful for submission.

## Handoff Queue For Claude / Lot

1. ~~**Start with FW-005.**~~ Done on 2026-05-04. See FW-005 below for shipped scope and `docs/zerion-readiness.md` for setup. `pnpm build` was green after the change.
2. **Resolve FW-007 with the owner.** Do not partially ship Source Currency or Expense Proof unless the ledger/storage implications are handled end-to-end. The likely hackathon-safe answer is to keep both as future or explicitly mocked in submission copy.
3. **Keep commits sequential.** Commit feature/code first, then docs/status updates. Do not add co-author trailers.
4. **Quality gate after code changes:** run `pnpm build`. Known warnings from previous runs: workspace-root inference from another lockfile, two unused eslint-disable directives, and `bigint` pure-JS fallback.

### FW-010 Planning Notes (deferred)

- Payable Settlement Requests should extend Settlement Request Links for payment-aware agents, not replace the human wallet flow.
- Add Agent Spending Policies before any agent can pay: per-Settlement cap, daily cap, Group scope, counterparty scope, USDC-only asset scope, expiry, revocation, and human fallback threshold.
- Planned endpoints: `POST /api/agent/spending-policies`, `GET /api/agent/spending-policies`, `PATCH /api/agent/spending-policies/{policyId}`, `POST /api/agent/settlement-requests`, `GET /api/agent/settlement-requests/{requestId}`, `POST /api/agent/settlement-requests/{requestId}/pay`, and `POST /api/agent/settlement-requests/{requestId}/verify`.
- Group ownership should stay administrative. Add ownership transfer/recovery before agent-created Groups become first-class.
- See `docs/agentic-settlement-endpoint.md` and `docs/agent-payment-policy.md`.

### FW-005 Implementation Notes (shipped 2026-05-04)

- Official Zerion CLI docs say to use commands such as `zerion analyze <address>` for complete wallet analysis; JSON output is the default and `--format human` is available for readable output.
- Prefer `ZERION_API_KEY` for auth. Optional x402 can be documented, but do not require it and do not invent keys.
- The output should be framed as `wallet-readiness support`: USDC readiness, SOL-for-gas readiness, and broader wallet context when Zerion exposes it.
- It must not become wallet connection, identity, signing, or Settlement execution. Solana wallet-adapter remains the identity and money-movement path.
- If the CLI is missing, fail with a clear setup message instead of hiding the error.

**Shipped:** `scripts/zerion-readiness.mjs` + `pnpm zerion:readiness` + `docs/zerion-readiness.md`. The script defensively walks the CLI's JSON output to tolerate upstream schema drift, sums USDC and SOL on Solana, and emits either a human verdict or `--json` for downstream tooling. Auth is pass-through; x402 is documented as optional and the script does not implement payment logic itself.

## FW-001 - Run Full Split Mode Devnet Rehearsal And Capture Blockers

**Status:** Done  
**Priority:** P0  
**Type:** AFK  
**Blocked by:** None

### What to verify

Run the exact judge demo path on devnet with real wallets:

`Group -> invite / join -> Expense -> Balance -> Settlement -> Receipt`

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] A new Split Mode Group can be created from `/groups` after wallet connect.
- [x] A second wallet can join by invite link or QR with an explicit `Join {GroupName}` action.
- [x] A Member can create an Expense with the expected split method.
- [x] Balances and suggested Settlement edges match the ledger state.
- [x] A debtor can complete a USDC Settlement on devnet.
- [x] The Receipt route loads after Settlement and shows the transaction signature.
- [x] Any blocker is recorded below this issue or split into a new issue.

### Notes

Marked complete on 2026-05-04 from owner report: the full Split Mode path was checked in the previous session and works.

### User Stories Covered

1, 2, 5, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 25, 26, 31, 32, 33, 34

## FW-002 - Harden Settlement Failure States On Devnet

**Status:** Done  
**Priority:** P0  
**Type:** AFK  
**Blocked by:** FW-001

### What to build

Make Settlement and Contribution preflight states understandable before wallet signing, especially when a Member lacks Solana USDC, lacks SOL for gas, or the recipient token account needs to be created.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Insufficient-USDC state names the missing asset and amount clearly.
- [x] Insufficient-SOL-for-gas state explains that SOL is only needed for transaction fees.
- [x] Recipient token-account creation is described as a one-time setup when applicable.
- [x] Wallet rejection, failed simulation, failed send, and failed receipt verification have distinct user-facing messages.
- [x] The normal successful Settlement path still lands on a Receipt.
- [x] `pnpm build` passes.

### Notes

Completed on 2026-05-04. Funding-gap copy now points to `Top up to settle` or `Add funds`; transaction simulation, send, confirmation, cancellation, duplicate-recording, and receipt-recording failures now show distinct messages. Successful Settlement still routes to the Receipt page.

## FW-003 - Sign Off Responsive QA For The Core Demo Path

**Status:** Done  
**Priority:** P0  
**Type:** HITL  
**Blocked by:** FW-001

### What to verify

Manually test the consumer path at mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints, with special attention to wallet gates, modals, join recovery, Settlement Request Links, and Receipt rendering.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Landing page, `/groups`, Group detail, Expense dialog, join flow, Settlement dialog, and Receipt are checked at `375`, `768`, and `1280`.
- [x] Text does not overlap or clip inside buttons, cards, dialogs, or headers.
- [x] Wallet connect CTAs are reachable above the fold on mobile.
- [x] Settlement Request Links restore live settlement context after connect and never auto-send.
- [x] Findings are either fixed immediately or added as new indexed issues.

### Notes

Completed on 2026-05-04. Browser QA covered landing, disconnected `/groups`, wallet modal, `/demo` Expense / Balance / Settlement / Receipt steps, and Group-not-found recovery at mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints. Owner previously checked the live connected-wallet Group path; no new blocker was found there. Two demo-story fixes were committed during this pass:

- `fix(demo): format expense amounts correctly`
- `fix(demo): align settlement story with debtor flow`

## FW-004 - Polish LI.FI Top Up To Settle Handoff

**Status:** Done  
**Priority:** P1  
**Type:** AFK  
**Blocked by:** FW-002

### What to build

Make LI.FI a support path for debtors who cannot settle because their funds are off Solana. The user-facing path should say `Add funds` or `Top up to settle`, then return to the same Group Settlement flow.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Insufficient-USDC Settlement state offers `Top up to settle` when LI.FI can help.
- [x] Copy avoids bridge jargon and does not imply cross-chain creditor settlement.
- [x] Route completion returns the debtor to the Group Settlement context.
- [x] The Receipt and ledger model remain unchanged after top-up.
- [x] Mainnet-sensitive warnings and error states are clear.
- [x] `pnpm build` passes.

### Notes

Completed on 2026-05-04. The LI.FI support path now uses top-up language, closes back to the Group after successful execution, and keeps Settlement / Receipt behavior unchanged.

## FW-005 - Add Zerion CLI Wallet-Readiness Support Demo

**Status:** Done  
**Priority:** P1  
**Type:** AFK  
**Blocked by:** FW-002

### What to build

Create a narrow Zerion CLI support demo around wallet readiness and next actions. It should strengthen the settlement story without replacing Solana wallet identity or entering the core Settlement path.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Zerion CLI usage is isolated behind a small boundary or script.
- [x] The demo can analyze a wallet and summarize readiness for FundWise Settlements.
- [x] Output distinguishes missing USDC, missing gas, and broader wallet context when available.
- [x] The feature is framed as support / analysis, not wallet connection.
- [x] Required credentials or CLI setup are documented without inventing secrets.
- [x] `pnpm build` passes after the code/docs change.

### Notes

Completed on 2026-05-04. Shipped as a standalone Node.js wrapper around the official `zerion analyze <address>` CLI:

- Script: `scripts/zerion-readiness.mjs`
- Package script: `pnpm zerion:readiness <address>` (also supports `--json` and `--min-usdc=<n>`)
- Docs: `docs/zerion-readiness.md` (setup, usage, exit codes, optional x402 path)

The script reports USDC on Solana, SOL for gas, and broader wallet context, then prints a `READY` / `NOT READY` verdict with concrete reasons. Exit codes: `0` ready, `1` not ready, `2` setup or invocation error. If the `zerion` CLI is missing it fails fast with a clear install message instead of hiding the error. Auth is pass-through to the CLI via `ZERION_API_KEY`; optional x402 is documented in `docs/zerion-readiness.md` but not required and no secrets are invented. Strictly read-only support tooling — does not connect a wallet, sign transactions, or execute Settlements.

`pnpm build` passed with the same pre-existing warnings noted in STATUS.md (workspace-root inference, two unused eslint-disable directives, bigint pure-JS fallback).

## FW-006 - Prepare Judge-Facing Demo Script And Submission Assets

**Status:** Done  
**Priority:** P0  
**Type:** HITL  
**Blocked by:** FW-001, FW-003

### What to produce

Create the script, screenshots, and submission copy around one clear story: private Group, Expense, live Balance, USDC Settlement, Receipt. Sponsor layers should appear only after judges understand the core product.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Demo script fits within the expected submission video length.
- [x] Screenshots cover Group creation, Expense entry, Balance, Settlement, and Receipt.
- [x] Submission copy leads with Visa / consumer payments fit.
- [x] LI.FI is described as `Top up to settle`, not as generic multichain settlement.
- [x] Zerion is described as wallet-readiness support, not wallet auth.
- [x] Fund Mode, Fundy, Agent Skill Endpoint, and Scoped Agent Access are marked as future direction unless actually shipped.

### Notes

Completed on 2026-05-04. See [SUBMISSION.md](./SUBMISSION.md) for the demo script, screenshot checklist, submission copy, track framing, and explicit claims to avoid.

## FW-007 - Decide Whether Source Currency And Expense Proof Ship In The Demo

**Status:** Ready  
**Priority:** P2  
**Type:** HITL  
**Blocked by:** FW-006

### What to decide

Decide whether Source Currency entry and Expense Proof upload are actual demo features, clickable mockups, or roadmap copy only. Do not partially ship either feature in a way that can corrupt Balance or Settlement math.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Source Currency scope is explicitly marked as shipped, mocked, or future.
- [ ] Expense Proof scope is explicitly marked as shipped, mocked, or future.
- [ ] If Source Currency ships, every Expense stores converted USD/USDC ledger value plus Exchange Rate Snapshot.
- [ ] If Expense Proof ships, file/link storage, preview, and access rules are documented.
- [ ] Submission copy matches the actual shipped state.

### Notes

Ready for owner / agent decision. Hackathon-safe default: do not ship either as real product behavior unless the next agent can complete the end-to-end ledger and storage path without risking Balance or Settlement correctness.

## FW-008 - Fund Mode Proposal Lifecycle

**Status:** Deferred  
**Priority:** P3  
**Type:** HITL  
**Blocked by:** Post-hackathon

### What to build later

Complete Fund Mode Proposals after Split Mode plus LI.FI are reliable. This includes reimbursement-first Proposal creation, approval, rejection, proof, edit history, and explicit execution.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Proposal creation, approval, rejection, and execution are complete.
- [ ] Proposer cannot approve their own reimbursement Proposal.
- [ ] Rejection closes the Proposal and retries require a new Proposal.
- [ ] Execution is a separate explicit action after threshold approval.
- [ ] Treasury payout goes to a Member wallet in the first Proposal shape.

## FW-009 - Fundy, Agent Skill Endpoint, And Scoped Agent Access

**Status:** Deferred  
**Priority:** P3  
**Type:** HITL  
**Blocked by:** Post-hackathon

### What to build later

Build the agent and Telegram surfaces only after the shared web app and wallet-bound backend are stable. Fundy should call FundWise HTTP APIs, use short-lived Telegram link codes, and keep money movement wallet-confirmed in the app.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Public `https://fundwise.kairen.xyz/skill.md` returns a machine-readable markdown document.
- [ ] Scoped Agent Access supports expiring, revocable capabilities tied to Member wallet, Group, and action type.
- [ ] Fundy runs as a separate Railway service under `services/fundy/`.
- [ ] Telegram-to-wallet linking uses web-generated short-lived codes in DM.
- [ ] On-chain Settlement, Contribution, and Proposal execution deep-link back to the web app for wallet confirmation.
