# FundWise

**Splitwise on Solana.** Create a private Group, log shared Expenses, see live Balances, and settle exact USDC amounts on Solana with a clear Receipt.

FundWise also has a second mode, **Fund Mode**, for pooled USDC Treasuries. That remains part of the product direction, but proposal flows are still incomplete and the current MVP is optimized around **Split Mode**.

## Current Product Shape

### Split Mode

The current MVP path is:

`Group -> Expense -> Balance -> Settlement -> Receipt`

- Web app first
- `/groups` uses a wallet-first entry state so disconnected users can connect immediately and continue into their Group list
- After wallet connect, the app should restore the exact intent the user came for: invite-linked Group, Settlement Request Link, or first Group creation
- Plain `/groups` with no existing Groups should open Group creation immediately; returning users with existing Groups should stay on the Group list
- Group creation defaults to Split Mode; Fund Mode is visible as an invite-only beta inside the create flow rather than a public default path
- Wallet-native auth (`@solana/wallet-adapter-*`); optional Phantom Connect may layer on later (see ADR-0014)
- Wallet-signed browser-session verification gates protected Group ledger reads and Receipts
- Invite link or QR join flow with an explicit `Join {GroupName}` confirmation after connect
- Settlement Request Links open the live settleable state and context, but never auto-send a Settlement
- USDC-only settlement asset
- Planned multi-currency Expense entry converts a Source Currency amount into a stored USD/USDC ledger value using an Exchange Rate Snapshot
- Planned Expense Proof upload lets Members attach a merchant receipt photo, PDF, or proof link to an Expense
- Activity Feed, not chat
- Current net Group Balance settlement, not per-Expense settlement

### Fund Mode

Fund Mode remains in the product and repo, but it is not the primary hackathon demo path.

- Group-owned Treasury using Squads primitives
- Contributions into Treasury
- Public Group creation keeps Fund Mode invite-only for now; internal testing can be re-enabled with `FUNDWISE_FUND_MODE_INVITE_WALLETS`
- Proposal / approval / execution flow still pending and not part of the current hackathon mainline

### Sponsor layers

- `LI.FI` is the primary sponsor support layer after Split Mode hardening. It lets EVM-first users top up into Solana USDC through an `Add funds` / `Top up to settle` flow without needing to understand the underlying route details.
- `Zerion` is a secondary intelligence layer for wallet analysis, reminders, and future FundWise Agent flows.
- **FundWise Agent** is the preferred umbrella name for later assistant surfaces. Telegram bot and Telegram mini app are channels for it, not a separate product.
- **Fundy** is the planned hosted Telegram bot that will run the FundWise Agent. Fundy Lite (hackathon) is command-based with Zerion wallet analysis. Fundy Full (post-hackathon) adds LLM via OpenRouter for natural language, personal finance features, budgets, and proactive reminders. See ADR-0018.
- **Agent Skill Endpoint** (`/skill.md`) is the planned public URL at **`https://fundwise.kairen.xyz/skill.md`** that autonomous agents can `curl` to discover FundWise capabilities, what to call vs avoid, supported actions, and how to authenticate through Scoped Agent Access.

Neither sponsor integration should complicate the primary Split Mode settlement path.

### Hosted app and agent discovery

- Production web app: **`https://fundwise.kairen.xyz`**
- Planned Agent Skill: **`https://fundwise.kairen.xyz/skill.md`**

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind v4, Radix / shadcn UI
- Wallets: `@solana/wallet-adapter-*` (primary); optional `@phantom/react-sdk` when Portal is configured
- Chain: Solana devnet for now
- Settlement asset: USDC
- Off-chain state: Supabase / Postgres
- Fund Mode Treasury: Squads (`@sqds/multisig`)
- Cross-chain support: LI.FI SDK

## Group Dashboard Structure

The main Group route is no longer a single giant page component.

- `app/groups/[id]/page.tsx` is the route shell and UI wiring layer.
- `hooks/use-group-dashboard.ts` owns Group loading, membership checks, shareable Settlement Request Links, Settlement execution, Treasury initialization, Contribution persistence, and profile-name persistence.
- `components/group-dashboard/` holds the Split Mode dashboard, Fund Mode dashboard, sidebar, Expense dialog, and profile dialog as focused UI modules.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node 20+
- `pnpm`
- A Solana wallet
- A Solana RPC URL
- A Supabase project with the current schema applied

### Install

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Environment

Create `.env.local` manually. The repo does not currently ship an `.env.example`.

Required keys used by the app:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `FUNDWISE_SESSION_SECRET`

Fallback compatibility is present for:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

### Run

```bash
pnpm dev
pnpm build
pnpm lint
pnpm test          # vitest — expense engine unit tests
```

Current verification state:

- `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` passes
- `pnpm lint` passes
- `pnpm build` passes
- `pnpm test` — 32 tests passing (expense engine splits, balances, settlement graph)

### Database Bootstrap

The base FundWise tables now live in `supabase/migrations/`, not only in `supabase/schema.sql`.

If a remote Supabase project was linked before that bootstrap migration existed, backfill it with:

```bash
supabase db push --include-all
```

## MVP Notes

- Solana devnet is the active execution environment for now.
- Mainnet-beta comes later, after the devnet hardening and rehearsal path is finished.
- Members need SOL for gas even though Settlements use USDC.
- FundWise now preflights stablecoin transfers before the wallet prompt so users see insufficient-USDC, insufficient-SOL, and token-account-creation guidance earlier.
- The current execution order is:
  devnet settlement hardening -> manual QA -> LI.FI top-up / add-funds flow -> Zerion and FundWise Agent / Telegram support layers -> Fundy (hosted Telegram bot) -> Agent Skill Endpoint + Scoped Agent Access -> later Fund Mode proposals
- Planned Expense entry expansion: allow Source Currency input, show a current exchange-rate quote, save the Exchange Rate Snapshot, and keep Balances / Settlements in the converted USD/USDC ledger value.
- Planned proof expansion: allow one lightweight receipt photo / PDF upload or proof link on an Expense.
- The current docs source of truth is split across [STATUS.md](./STATUS.md), [CONTEXT.md](./CONTEXT.md), and [PRD.md](./PRD.md). If another doc disagrees, those three win.
